Which automaton do you want? (type 0 to quit)
-> 15
|    |   State | a   | b   | c   | d   |
|:---|--------:|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|    |       0 | [0] | --  | --  | --  |
| I  |       1 | [1] | [2] | [3] | [4] |
|    |       2 | [0] | [2] | [3] | [4] |

| F  |       4 | [0] | [0] | [0] | [4] |
Not standard: transition to initial state
The automaton is deterministic
Not complete: transition to nowhere in state 0

What do you want to do?

1- Standardisation
2- Determinization and completion
3- Minimization
4- Read a word
5- Complementary automaton
6- Select another automaton
0- Quit

-> 1
Standardization done, the automaton is now:

|    |   State | a   | b   | c   | d   |
|:---|--------:|:----|:----|:----|:----|

|    |       1 | [1] | [2] | [3] | [4] |
|    |       2 | [0] | [2] | [3] | [4] |
|    |       3 | [0] | [0] | [3] | [4] |
