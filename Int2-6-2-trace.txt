Which automaton do you want? (type 0 to quit)
-> 
|     |   State | a   |
|:----|--------:|:----|
| I F |       0 | [0] |
Not standard: transition to initial state
The automaton is deterministic
The automaton is complete

What do you want to do?

1- Standardisation
2- Determinization and completion
3- Minimization
4- Read a word
5- Complementary automaton
6- Select another automaton
0- Quit

-> Standardization done, the automaton is now:

|     |   State | a   |
|:----|--------:|:----|
| F   |       0 | [0] |
| I F |       1 | [0] |

What do you want to do?

1- Standardisation
2- Determinization and completion
3- Minimization
4- Read a word
5- Complementary automaton
6- Select another automaton
0- Quit

-> This automaton is already deterministic and complete.

|     |   State | a   |
|:----|--------:|:----|
| F   |       0 | [0] |
| I F |       1 | [0] |
