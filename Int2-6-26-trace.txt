The automaton is standard
The automaton is deterministic
Not complete: transition to nowhere in state 0

What do you want to do?

1- Standardisation
2- Determinization and completion
3- Minimization
4- Read a word
5- Complementary automaton
6- Select another automaton
0- Quit

-> This automaton is already standard.
