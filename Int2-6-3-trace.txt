Which automaton do you want? (type 0 to quit)
-> 3
|    |   State | a   |
|:---|--------:|:----|
| I  |       0 | [1] |
| F  |       1 | --  |
The automaton is standard
The automaton is deterministic
Not complete: transition to nowhere in state 1

What do you want to do?

1- Standardisation
2- Determinization and completion
3- Minimization
4- Read a word
5- Complementary automaton
6- Select another automaton
0- Quit

-> 1
This automaton is already standard.

What do you want to do?

-> 2
Completion done, the automaton is now:

|    |   State | a   |
|:---|--------:|:----|
| I  |       0 | [1] |
| F  |       1 | [2] |
|    |       2 | [2] |

6- Select another automaton
0- Quit

-> 4
