Which automaton do you want? (type 0 to quit)
-> 
|    |   State | a      |
|:---|--------:|:-------|
| F  |       0 | [4]    |
| I  |       1 | [2, 4] |
|    |       2 | [3]    |
| F  |       3 | [0, 2] |
|    |       4 | [3, 5] |
|    |       5 | [0]    |
The automaton is standard
Not deterministic: more than one transition for a letter in state 1
The automaton is complete

What do you want to do?

1- Standardisation
2- Determinization and completion
3- Minimization
4- Read a word
5- Complementary automaton
6- Select another automaton
0- Quit

-> This automaton is already standard.

-> Determinization done, the automaton is already complete, it is now:

|    | State     | a           |
|:---|:----------|:------------|
| I  | 1         | [2·4]       |
