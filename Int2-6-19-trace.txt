Which automaton do you want? (type 0 to quit)
-> 19
|    |   State | a   |
|:---|--------:|:----|
| F  |       0 | [0] |
| I  |       1 | [2] |
|    |       2 | [0] |
The automaton is standard
The automaton is deterministic
The automaton is complete

What do you want to do?

1- Standardisation
2- Determinization and completion
3- Minimization
4- Read a word
5- Complementary automaton
6- Select another automaton
0- Quit

-> 1
