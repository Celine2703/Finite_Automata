The automaton is standard
The automaton is deterministic
Not complete: transition to nowhere in state 0

What do you want to do?

1- Standardisation
2- Determinization and completion
3- Minimization
4- Read a word
5- Complementary automaton
6- Select another automaton
0- Quit

-> 1
This automaton is already standard.

Completion done, the automaton is now:

|     |   State | a   | b   |
|:----|--------:|:----|:----|
| F   |       0 | [2] | [6] |
| I F |       1 | [2] | [6] |
|     |       2 | [3] | [3] |
|     |       3 | [4] | [6] |
|     |       4 | [5] | [5] |
|     |       5 | [0] | [6] |
