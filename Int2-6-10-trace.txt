Which automaton do you want? (type 0 to quit)
-> 
|     |   State | a   | b   |
|:----|--------:|:----|:----|
| I F |       0 | [1] | --  |
|     |       1 | [2] | [2] |
|     |       2 | [3] | --  |
|     |       3 | [4] | [4] |
|     |       4 | [0] | --  |
Not standard: transition to initial state
The automaton is deterministic
Not complete: transition to nowhere in state 0

What do you want to do?

1- Standardisation
2- Determinization and completion
3- Minimization
4- Read a word
5- Complementary automaton
6- Select another automaton
0- Quit

-> Standardization done, the automaton is now:

|     |   State | a   | b   |
|:----|--------:|:----|:----|
| F   |       0 | [1] | --  |
|     |       1 | [2] | [2] |
