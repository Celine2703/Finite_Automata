Which automaton do you want? (type 0 to quit)
-> 38
|     |   State | a   | b   |
|:----|--------:|:----|:----|
| I F |       0 | [1] | [3] |
| F   |       1 | [1] | [2] |
| F   |       2 | [3] | [3] |
| F   |       3 | [3] | [3] |
The automaton is standard
The automaton is deterministic
The automaton is complete

What do you want to do?

1- Standardisation
2- Determinization and completion
3- Minimization
4- Read a word
5- Complementary automaton
6- Select another automaton
0- Quit

-> 1
This automaton is already standard.
